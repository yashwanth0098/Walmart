It involves leveraging algorithms like Decision Trees and Random Forests, resulting in R-squared scores of 58% and 95% respectively. Furthermore, to discern demand, supply, and supply trends, forecasting sales for the upcoming 12 weeks will be conducted using the Holt-Winters model and the ARIMA model.
